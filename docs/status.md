## Project Summary: 
Since things may have changed since proposal (even if they havenâ€™t), write a shortparagraph summarizing the goals of the project (updated/improved version from the proposal).

## Approach:
Give a detailed description of your approach, in a few paragraphs. You should summarize themain algorithm you are using, such as by writing out the update equation (even if it is off-the-shelf). Youshould also give details about the approach as it applies to your scenario. For example, if you are usingreinforcement learning for a given scenario, describe the MDP in detail, i.e. how many states/actions youhave, what does the reward function look like. A good guideline is to incorporate sufficient details so thatmost of your approach is reproducible by a reader. I encourage you to use figures, as appropriate, for this,as I provided in the writeup for the first assignment (available here: http://sameersingh.org/courses/aiproj/sp17/assignments.html#assignment1). I recommend at least 2-3 paragraphs.

## Evaluation:
An important aspect of your project, as we mentioned in the beginning, is evaluating yourproject. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both quantitative and qualitativeresults. Present the results to convince the reader that you have a working implementation. Use plots, charts,tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as needed. I expect you will need at least a few paragraphs to describe eachtype of evaluation that you perform.

## Remaining Goals and Challenges:
In a few paragraphs, describe your goals for the next 2-3 weeks, whenthe final report is due. At the very least, describe how you consider your prototype to be limited, and whatyou want to add to make it a complete contribution. Note that if you think your algorithm is quite good,but have not performed sufficient evaluation, doing them can also be a reasonable goal. Similarly, you maypropose some baselines (such as a hand-coded policy) that you did not get a chance to implement, butwant to compare against for the final submission. Finally, given your experience so far, describe some of thechallenges you anticipate facing by the time your final report is due, how crippling you think it might be,and what you might do to solve them.
